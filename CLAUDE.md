# Agentic-OS — the economic loop

A rulebook for a task → verification → dispute → settlement loop among autonomous actors, and a
reference implementation of it with no strategies. Ten external reviews. The rulebook is **frozen at
v1.0.1**; what the rules do under self-interested participants has not been tested yet. Read
`HANDOFF.md` first for where things stand and what is proposed next.

## Layout

```
spec/agentic_economics_loop_spec_v1_0_1.md   the text in force (standalone; Appendix A defaults, E errata)
spec/history/                                v0.1 … v1.0 — superseded, kept for provenance only
reviews/                                     R01–R10, one external review per version, with the reviewer's notes
agentic_sim/                                 the engine, 18 invariants, 11 test suites, runner
docs/line_map_economic_loop_v1_0_1.txt       text export of the _line map of the loop (the live map is the source)
HANDOFF.md                                   status, history table, open questions, proposed next step
```

## Commands

```
cd agentic_sim
python3 run_tests.py        # expected: 156 passed, 0 failed, 24 expected failures
python3 -S run_tests.py     # same, with no site-packages
python3 -m pytest tests -q  # expected: 156 passed, 24 xfailed, 0 xpassed (conftest mirrors the runner)
```

Any other result is a regression — including an XPASS. The 24 expected failures each have a stated
reason in `run_tests.py` (`EXPECTED_FAIL`, with `EXPECTED_FAIL_PARAMS` naming the parameter runs inside a
mixed test): one original (a single-answer ⊥ appeal), four superseded by the reviewer-view contract,
nineteen on the withdrawn audit-reopening path. They are strict in both entry points: an expected
failure that passes means a withdrawn path is admitted again, and the run fails.

## Change discipline — spec §19, and the one rule that matters most

Classify a finding before acting on it:

| Finding | What it warrants |
|---|---|
| The engine misapplies a rule, or a refused action has effects | Fix the engine, add a regression test. **The rules do not move.** |
| Two active rules demand contradictory outcomes | The smallest explicit rule decision, versioned and labelled as a design revision |
| A workflow that would be useful but is not offered | A proposal for a later design revision — not an obligation to support it now |
| A strategy performs badly, or an incentive looks wrong | An evaluation under the fixed rules — not a rule change |
| The consolidated wording says more or less than the decisions | Errata (as in v1.0.1 Appendix E) |

A conformance pass may change *how* a rule is applied; a change to *what participants may do* is a
design revision and is read on its own before it is implemented. v0.9 broke this once (an interface
finding answered with a state-machine expansion); the next review found sixteen consequences and the
change was withdrawn, not repaired. Do not repeat it.

While building strategy runs, the baseline stays frozen. Drivers live in their own package (proposed:
`agentic_sim/drivers/`), use only the public operations of `World`, and never reach into engine internals.

## Conventions in `agentic_sim`

- Every action is validated whole before anything is recorded or moved. A refused action changes
  nothing — tests assert this against full world snapshots. Keep it that way for any new operation.
- Eighteen invariants run after every tick (`sim/invariants.py`). A failing invariant is an engine
  bug or a spec contradiction, never a property of a strategy.
- Reviewer test files (`tests/test_review*.py`) are kept **verbatim**. Never edit one to make it
  pass; if a reviewer test must fail, add it to `EXPECTED_FAIL` with the reason, and mirror it in
  `tests/conftest.py`.
- No strategies in the engine. Every bid, verdict, appeal, audit roll, ruling and human action is
  injected by the caller; `sim/strategies.py` holds Protocols only.
- Defaults are in `sim/params.py` and spec Appendix A. Moving a default is not a design change;
  changing a rule is.
- The engine has no bid registry, no selection and no audit roll: `award` takes the chosen actor,
  and `p_audit` per reviewer is maintained but never rolled. Offers, S_θ with λ and the κ tie band,
  and the audit roll are the driver's — by design. A driver that skips the roll or reads `p_audit`
  dishonestly produces an implementation effect, not an economic one (spec §18.2).
- There is no enforced read-only facade on `World`; "public operations only" is a convention. Put a
  thin read-only view in `drivers/` so the rule is checkable.
- The `History` hash chain in `sim/ledger.py` is the authoritative record; wallet events and case
  logs are copies that invariant I16 checks for membership and order.
- Money is checked by invariant I1 (conservation) — never silently create or lose credits.

## Vocabulary (spec Appendix C has the full notation)

F / N / P / ⊥ — fulfilled / not fulfilled / partially fulfilled / cannot assess. P and ⊥ are
responses to a submission, available only on the first review of an unrevised submission.
Pending — approved or appeal admitted, window open, actor's capacity released. Suspended — a challenge
or audit holds the case. Vested — financial finality. Ω — the orchestrator's operating account, a
revolving float. ρ reliability, κ duty credit. G guarantee, G^V reviewer bond, D court fee,
K reasonable-cost cap, φ verification deposit, β price ceiling, v_t credit value = Res_t / M_t.
"Ruling" has two senses: the orchestrator rules on splits inside the procedure; only a human
*overrides* it (spec §15.2).
